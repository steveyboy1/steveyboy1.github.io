<p>Hi, my name is Stephen Cure.
I am an Exercise Science Major at Bob Jones University and I am planning 
to graduate December 2017. I want to be a youth gymnastics coach and help 
kids overcome the obstacles of life by teaching them life principles through gymnastics.
I have been invovled in gymnastics and Parkour for 6 years and I love teaching and practicing
both of these sports.</p>
<p>I am currently a coach at Acrosmith Gymnastics located in Greenville South Carolina 
just off of Woodruff Road.</p>

<p>My responsibilities at Acrosmith Gymnastics consist of teaching the Ninja Class for the
6-13 year olds and assisting in coaching a junior tunbling class. The Ninja Class focuses on
fundemental movement skills such as climbing, swinging, and crawling, and also gives an introduction
to begginer parkour and gymnastics skills. The tumbling class ranges from 6 to 15 year olds and
focuses on imporving tumbling skills and helping kids get started in tumbling. </p>
<p>I have had the opurtunity to perform tumbling and parkour skills on stage at my school three
times during my college carrer. One of the most memorable times was a tumbling line I performed
alongside the famous Bob Reese during my school's production of the opera "Aida".
